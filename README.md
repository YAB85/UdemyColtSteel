# Web Developer Bootcamp

## This is the only complete beginner full-stack developer course that covers NodeJS.

### We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.

The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.


When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the "beginner friendly" classes.
